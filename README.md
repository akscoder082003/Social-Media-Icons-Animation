# Social-Media-Icons-Animation
 
Here I have used fonts from Font Awesome Kit.
The prefix fa and the icon's name is used in code to show the icon.
And fas for solid icon, fab for brand icon.

The :nth-of-type(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child, of the same type (tag name), of its parent.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
In this code the share button have higher stack order than others facebook, instagram, twitter, linkedin icons.

I have also used tranform property (translateX()), this shows the value of X-axis.
And transition-delay property specifies when the transition effect will start.

I have link facebook, instagram, twitter, linkedin icons in a single element link.
